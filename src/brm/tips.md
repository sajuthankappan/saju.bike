## BRM Tips

### BRM 1000 Tips

The most important aspect in such rides is sleep management. Here are some suggestions, based on my experience/practice.

Before the actual ride: Practice few days/rides to disturb your normal sleep cycle/pattern. Please note, you are trying to disturb something which you have been following from your birth:P So, it is going to be very difficult, but important. Repeat the practice, till "u" are in "control" over your sleep. (Quotes are intentional!)

There are many ways to disturb your sleep pattern. You could ride back to back night rides. i.e., ride 9-6 night on day1. Repeat the same for day 2. Please note, speed is not important, but staying awake is!


Another way is to ride at multiple time slots at night for consecutive days. For example, day 1 ride from 9pm to 12mid night. Day 2, from 12 midnight to 3am. Day 3, from 3am to 6am. The time duration is just an example. Please feel free to find what suits better for you.

On the real ride day, if you feel sleepy, please stop riding. Splash some water in your face; I sometimes combine that with small walking which makes me faster to come out of the sleep state. But, this is just a temporary solution. Find the next safe spot for sleep (say, bus shelter, petrol bunk, temple, or whatever feels a safe place for sleep), and keep the alarm in your mobile, for an hour or so, and sleep. Mosquitoes are typically an issue for sleeping. So, carry odomos or whatever works for that.

And, generally, it is okay not to sleep, if you don't feel sleepy. Forcing sleep mostly doesn't work, and you may end up wasting precious minutes/hours.

Taking tea/coffee at regular intervals at night helps a lot in controlling the sleep!

Regarding nutrition, please always carry atleast one meal with you. Tip: Chapatis can be handy to keep it even for a day or two; and it doesn't get spoiled that easily (if carried without curry/gravy). So I found it to be a good "reserve" food.

Please feel free to carry energy bars/gels. But prefer using them only when you are completely exhausted. I personally try to keep myself energised through normal food, as much as possible. 

Another most important thing is time management. My usual pattern is ~15mins max for small breaks (tea/snacks). For food breaks, try to keep it around 30mins. Anything more than that, you are actually wasting valuable time; most times, without you even realising it. So, plan accordingly.

One more difficulty could be finding CP locations; actually missing them is quite easy :P. Please keep looking out for the CPs 2-3kms before the target km mentioned in the brevet card. (Sometimes the kms mentioned are very inaccurate, as much as 2-5kms)

Hope this helps in some way.

All the best!
