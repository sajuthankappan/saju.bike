### If I finish 300 KM comfortably can I finish 600 KM?

No.  Planning, sleep management becomes critical from 400 onwards, especially 600. So, comfortable finish of 300 do not mean, you are ready for 400/600.

### Am I ready to do SR?

If u are able to finish 100 comfortably within 6 hours (including breaks), you most likely will finish 200 and 300 comfortably.

400 onwards, it gets a little more tricky. Planning, sleep management becomes critical from 400 onwards, especially 600.

### I finished an SR. Will I be able to do 1000+ rides?

Yes, If u can finish 600 comfortably, 1000 is most easy, because expected average speed after 600 drops drastically. i.e, till 600 the expected avg speed is 15. After 600 it drops to 12 or 12.5. so, you have more time for sleep and rest after 600..
